2. Student Class: Inherits from Person and adds a private _status property with its getter and setter.

3. Date Class: A simple class to represent a date with day, month, and year.

4. Employee Class: Inherits from Person and adds private _office, _salary, and _dateHired properties with their getters and setters.
