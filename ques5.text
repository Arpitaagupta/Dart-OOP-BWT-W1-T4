Ques-5

Create a class Job with following attributes:
a. Data Members: Designation, Salary, Id
b. Create constructors and setters and getters for all
Modify the Employee class and add a Job Object as data member.
Modify the constructors and display function of Employee class accordingly
Create a new method in Employee class that checks if Salary of the Employee is greater
than 50,000.

Explanation:
1. Job Class:
Defines attributes designation, salary, and id.
Provides constructors to initialize these attributes.
Includes getters and setters to access and modify these attributes.

2. Employee Class:
Includes attributes _name, _age, and _job (of type Job).
Constructor initializes _name, _age, and _job.
Getters and setters provide access to _name, _age, and _job.
isSalaryGreaterThan50k() checks if the salary of the _job object is greater than 50,000.
display() function prints employee details including job details.

3. Main Function:
Creates a Job object (job1) and an Employee object (emp1) with job1.
Displays emp1 details and checks if salary is greater than 50,000.
Modifies job1 salary and updates emp1 job details.
Displays modified emp1 details and checks salary condition again.
This setup demonstrates the use of classes, constructors, methods, getters, and setters in Dart to model an Employee with a Job, and perform operations such as checking salary conditions. Adjustments can be made as needed to fit specific requirements or additional functionalities.
